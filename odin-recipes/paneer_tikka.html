    <h1> Paneer Tikka </h1>
    <p>
        Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated
        in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don’t have an
        oven – instead of grilling in oven, you can make Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post
        I am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods.

        Ingredients You Need:

            Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese)
        </li>

    </p>

        Steps:
        1. Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to
        medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. <br>

        You will need ½ cup each of onions and capsicum. Set these aside. You can also use tomatoes if you want.

        2. Crush 1.5 inches ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium sized garlic to a fine paste in a mortar-pestle. <br>

        You will need 1 tablespoon of crushed ginger-garlic or 1 tablespoon of ready ginger-garlic paste.

        3. Slice 200 to 250 grams block or paneer into cubes or squares and keep aside. Best is to use homemade paneer.

        4. Put 200 grams hung curd (greek yogurt) in a bowl. With a whisk beat the curd lightly till smooth.

        5. Now add 1 tablespoons ginger garlic paste or 1 tablespoon crushed ginger garlic to the curd. Also add all the
        dry spice powders: <br>

    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chaat masala</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper powder (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    Kashmiri red chili powder gives a nice red color to the food but is not spicy and hot. <br>

    Instead of kashmiri red chilli powder, you can add 2 teaspoons of sweet paprika or ½ to 1 teaspoon of cayenne
    pepper. <br>

    6. Add ½ teaspoon black salt and regular salt as per taste. If you do not have black salt, then skip it.

    7. Add ½ tablespoon (1.5 teaspoons) lemon juice.

    10. Add the onions, capsicum and paneer to the marinade.<br>

    11. Slowly and gently mix them with the marinade. Cover and keep the marinated paneer and veggies in the
    refrigerator for 2 hours or more. <br>

    13. Begin to thread the veggies and paneer alternately on bamboo skewers. Before you begin to thread preheat
    oven at 230 or 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degree Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes. <br>

    Use only the top heating element while preheating as well as grilling. Soak or rinse the bamboo skewers before
    threading.
    <br>

    14. Place them on a tray lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper.

    16. Place the tray on the top rack and grill in the preheated oven for 7 to 10 minutes first at 230 to 240
    degrees Celsius or 464 degrees Fahrenheit. <br>

    17. Then remove the tray from the oven and turn the paneer tikka skewers.

    18. Again keep back on the top rack in the oven and continue to grill till the edges of paneer and veggies are
    golden or slightly charred for about 3 to 5 minutes. <br>

    Do not grill for a long time as then paneer becomes hard. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven do keep a
    check. <br>

    You can reduce or increase the time as required. Total grilling time will be 15 to 20 minutes.

    chutney, onion slices and lemon wedges as sides. <br>
